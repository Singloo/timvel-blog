> **有效期: *12* 个月**  *[什么是有效期?](https://blog.timvel.com/2020/12/28/12-28-2020-a-description-of-the-validity-period/)*

不久前做了一个非常清晰的梦, 梦中我在一个超市, 身边是同学, 似乎在挑选午餐. </br>
场景极其真实, 没有不合理的片段. 我选了一份煎饼, 有4个, 每层之间都有酱汁, 当时酱汁滴到我手上, 触感极其清晰.

后来我又买鸡腿, 像是卤过的, 有些鸡腿不完整, 缺肉, 我挑了几个完整了. 这时有个人出来指责我

"你把好的都挑去了, 剩下的坏的卖给谁?"</br>
"你什么意思?" 我回答</br>
"剩下的卖不掉, 只能促销" (后面还说了一些, 忘记了, 大概是老板会亏本)</br>
"哦? 那你是支持人民还是资本家?"</br>
"你什么意思?" 他用我的话反驳了我</br>
"一斤鸡腿才3块多, 超市处理一下就可以卖XX元(我忘记了牌子上的价格). 除去调料费用, 已经翻了几倍的价格, 就算剩下不完整的鸡腿用来促销, 资本家也早已得到足够的利润."</br>
"普通工人拿到的薪水已经是创造价值打折过的, 还要在买个鸡腿的时候继续被剥削一些" (balabala, 记不清了)</br>

这时候超市服务员过来阻止了我们争吵.

这段场景毫无特殊之处, 关键之处在于, 我在梦中像现实中一样思考, 问别人"你什么意思"像是我会干出的事, 通常说这句话的意义在于, 让我有足够的思考时间, 示弱, 让对方放松, 顺便引出对方更多的话.

而在很久以前, 我的梦通常很模糊, 几个重复的场景, 没注意是彩色或者黑白.

过了几年, 我能模糊的看见, 但经常无法控制自己, 我无法看见, 或者无法行动, 无法说话. 

直到最近, 我才发现, 我做的梦都是彩色, 且无比清晰, 而且有时可以思考. 虽然有时的梦极其离奇, 但回想起来还是很有趣的, 但我已经希望做有序的梦.

我百度 梦是黑白的吗? 有研究显示90%的人做的是黑白的梦. 至于彩色和黑白的界限是什么, 无序和有序的梦由什么决定, 我无法给出确切答案, 但又感觉了解一些, 我经历过这些阶段, 相信将来也能做到完全控制梦境.

Few days ago, I had a very lucid dream. In that dream, I was in a supermarket, by my side were my classmates. We seemed to being picking food for lunch. 

This scenario was extremely realistic, and without any erratical footage. I grabbed a box of pancakes, contained four pancakes, with sauce between each of them. At that time, the sauce dripped on my finger, the feeling was very clear.

Then I went to buy some drumsticks, looked like marinated one. Some legs are incomplete, lack of parts, I picked out those complete ones. Then a guy just came out and criticize me.

"If you picked out all the complete ones, who's gonna buy the incomplete rest?"</br>
"What do you mean?" I replied</br>
"If no one buy the incomplete ones, the rest have to be promoted"(He said some other words, but I have forgotted about it)</br>
"So, you are on the side people or capitalist?"</br>
"What do you mean?" He retorted me with my words.</br>
"Half a kilo of chicken leg only cost about 3 yuan, but after processing, the supermarket will sell it at XX yuan(I forgot the price on the price tag). Exclude the cost of seasoning, the sell price has multiplied several times. The capitalist already got enought profit, even the rest incomplete drumsticks are left to promote"</br>
"Part of the salary of average workers has been taken by capitalist when they create value, now they will be exploited again even when buying a drumstick"(I forgot about the detail)</br>

At that moment the supermarket staff came and stopped us.

Nothing special about this scenario, the key point is, I think in dream as I do in reality. Asking someone "What do you mean?" is something I'll do in reality. Usually this is meant to give me enough time to think, and show weakness to make people at ease, and elicit more words from people.

In face, very long time ago, my dreams were a blur, some replicated scenario, didn't notice they were black and white or colorful.

Over some years, I could vaguely see, but couldn't control myself at most time. I couldn't see, or move, or talk.

It was only recently that I realized that my dreams were colorful, lucid, and sometimes I can think. I still have erratical dreams sometimes, although they are fun to look back on, I still want my dreams in order.

I searched "Are dreams black and white". Studies have shown 90% of dreams are black and white. As for the boundary between colorful and black and white, and what makes a dream disordered or orderly, I can't provide a definite answer, but I feel I know something about it, since I have experienced these stages. I think I will have dream completely in control in the future
